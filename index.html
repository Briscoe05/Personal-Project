<p>Hi. My name is Matthew Brown. I am from a small town in New Jersey but currently reside in the State of New York. I have been apart of many life experiences which helped in my develpomental growth within my personal and professional life, however I currently want to pursue new opportunities and gain new skillsets. I would like to meet, network, and collaborate with other liked-minded individuals as myself. I believe fostering a community of people, who not only want to excell but want to help others do the same, is a great endeavor. </p>
<br>

<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I have been in the professional space since the early 2000's until today. Majority of my professional experience has been within the retail and residential sales industry. I have plenty of customer service experience and built great relationships over the last decade. I also have had the pleasure of participating in the food service industry. Serving on multiple waitstaff opportunities while having the chance to host has helped me develop soft skills that are beneficial and could transferable to other sectors. I am currently in pursuit of a career in the tech industry as I see it as a way to expand my knowledge and skillset of unfamiliar territory. I am enrolled in a course curriculum that is a great entry in to the field.</p>
